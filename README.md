# shelducks-borgarfjordur

These data and code accompany a paper on Common Shelduck abundance in Borgarfjörður, western Iceland, in which we investigated how Shelduck abundance was affected by date (week), tidal state and subsite. One low and rising tide survey was conducted each week between 12th March and 25th October 2017.  

It includes raw data, and scripts on data exploration, model selection and model validation.
